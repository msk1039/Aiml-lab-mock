    "# Tower of Hanoi Problem\n",
    "The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle involving three rods and a number of disks of different sizes. The objective is to move the entire stack from one rod to another, following these rules:\n",
    "- Only one disk can be moved at a time\n",
    "- A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty rod\n",
    "- All disks start on the first rod in ascending order (smallest on top)\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum number of moves required is **2^n - 1** where n is the number of disks. We solve this recursively by breaking it into smaller subproblems."
