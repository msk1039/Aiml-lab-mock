1. Implement the Informed Search algorithm for real-life problems.
2. Design an algorithm using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from a start node
to a goal node in a maze represented as a grid graph. The maze contains obstacles (walls) and free
cells. Implement BFS to ensure that the first found path is the optimal one in terms of the number
of steps.
3. Implement a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to traverse a tree or graph representing a game
map. The goal is to explore all possible paths from the starting node to the target location,
marking visited nodes to avoid cycles, and visualize the order of traversal.
4. Develop a pathfinding solution using the A* algorithm for a maze-based game environment. The
agent must find the most cost-efficient route from the start position to the goal, considering
movement costs and a suitable heuristic function (e.g., Manhattan distance) to guide the search
efficiently.
5. Implementation of 8 puzzles game.
6. Implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe game.
7. Implementation of Tower of Hanoi game.
8. Implementation of Water jug problems.

features. Apply K-Fold Cross-Validation to validate the model.
12. Build a Linear Regression model from scratch to predict students’ final exam scores based on
their study hours. Implement all computations manually (without using built-in regression
libraries) — including parameter estimation, prediction, and model evaluation using Mean
Squared Error (MSE) and R2 Score.
13. Build a Linear Regression model to predict students’ exam scores using study hours, attendance,
and internal marks. Validate model accuracy using K-Fold Cross-Validation.

customer footfall. Use 5-Fold Cross-Validation to assess prediction accuracy.
16. Apply the Naïve Bayes algorithm to a real-world classification problem such as email spam
detection, sentiment analysis, or disease diagnosis. Train and test the model, then evaluate its
performance using a Confusion Matrix and related metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and
F1-score.

such as email spam detection, sentiment analysis, or disease diagnosis.

18. Implementation an Email Spam Detection model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for
binary classification, where emails are categorized as Normal (Not Spam) or Abnormal (Spam).
Apply oversampling or undersampling techniques to handle class imbalance and analyze model
performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
