    "# Linear Regression from Scratch\n",
    "Here we implement single-variable linear regression **without** using machine learning libraries. The idea is to fit a line `y = m x + b` that minimises squared errors between predictions and real exam scores. We use closed-form formulas to compute the slope `m` and intercept `b`, then evaluate the model with **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R^2 Score**."
