    "# Naïve Bayes for Email Spam Detection\n",
    "Naïve Bayes applies Bayes' theorem with the **naïve** assumption that features are conditionally independent. For text classification we convert each message into word-count features. The model estimates how likely each word appears in spam vs. normal mail and combines these independent probabilities to choose the most probable class. Because probabilities multiply, we work in log space to avoid underflow. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score provide a balanced picture of performance, while the confusion matrix highlights specific error types."
