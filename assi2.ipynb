    "# BFS for Shortest Path in a Maze\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is an uninformed search algorithm that explores nodes level by level. It guarantees finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs because it expands all nodes at distance k before exploring nodes at distance k+1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm: BFS for Maze Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties:\n",
    "- **Complete**: Always finds a solution if one exists\n",
    "- **Optimal**: Guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V is vertices, E is edges\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the queue\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Steps:\n",
    "1. **Initialize**:\n",
    "   - Create a queue and add the start cell\n",
    "   - Create a parent map to reconstruct the path\n",
    "2. **Loop** while queue is not empty:\n",
    "   - Dequeue the front cell\n",
    "   - If it's the goal, stop and reconstruct path\n",
    "   - For each valid neighbor (up, down, left, right):\n",
    "     - If not visited and not a wall:\n",
    "       - Mark as visited\n",
    "       - Store parent relationship\n",
    "       - Add to queue\n",
    "3. **Reconstruct** path by backtracking from goal to start using parent map\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maze Representation\n",
    "- `0` = Free cell (can walk through)\n",
    "- `1` = Wall (blocked)\n",
    "- Movements: Up, Down, Left, Right (4-directional)"
