    "# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Implementation\n",
    "Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3×3 grid. Players take turns marking spaces with X or O. The player who places three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. This implementation includes:\n",
    "- A simple text-based interface\n",
    "- Win detection logic checking rows, columns, and diagonals\n",
    "- Draw detection when the board is full\n",
