    "### Understanding the 8-Puzzle and BFS\n",
    "\n",
    "The 8-puzzle is a classic sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one blank space. The goal is to rearrange the tiles from a random starting configuration into a sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at a selected node (the \"root\") and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why BFS for the 8-Puzzle?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Completeness**: If a solution exists, BFS is guaranteed to find it.\n",
    "- **Optimality**: BFS always finds the shortest path (in terms of the number of moves) from the start state to the goal state. This is because it explores the puzzle state layer by layer, so it finds the goal at the shallowest possible depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization**: Start with a queue and add the initial puzzle state to it. Use a set or dictionary to keep track of visited states to avoid cycles and redundant work.\n",
    "2.  **Iteration**: While the queue is not empty, dequeue the current state.\n",
    "3.  **Goal Test**: Check if the current state is the goal state. If it is, we're done.\n",
    "4.  **Expansion**: If not, generate all valid neighboring states (by sliding the blank tile up, down, left, or right).\n",
    "5.  **Enqueue**: For each new, unvisited neighbor, mark it as visited and add it to the back of the queue. We also store its \"parent\" state so we can reconstruct the path later."

Using `yield` makes this a generator, which is memory-efficient as it produces the new states one by one on demand."
