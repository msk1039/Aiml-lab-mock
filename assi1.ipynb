    "# Informed Search Algorithm - Greedy Best-First Search\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "Informed search algorithms use **heuristics** (estimated costs to reach the goal) to guide the search more efficiently than blind search methods. Unlike uninformed searches that explore nodes randomly or systematically, informed searches prioritize nodes that appear closer to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm: Greedy Best-First Search\n",
    "**Greedy Best-First Search** always expands the node that appears closest to the goal according to the heuristic function h(n). It uses a priority queue ordered by heuristic values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Steps:\n",
    "1. **Initialize**: Add start node to priority queue with its heuristic value\n",
    "2. **Loop**:\n",
    "   - Remove node with lowest h(n) from queue\n",
    "   - If it's the goal, return the path\n",
    "   - Mark node as visited\n",
    "   - For each unvisited neighbor:\n",
    "     - Calculate heuristic h(neighbor)\n",
    "     - Add to priority queue\n",
    "3. **Return**: Path from start to goal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Heuristic h(n)**: Estimated cost from node n to goal (must be optimistic)\n",
    "- **Admissible heuristic**: Never overestimates the actual cost\n",
    "- **Complete**: Not guaranteed if infinite paths exist\n",
    "- **Optimal**: Not guaranteed; greedy choice may miss better paths\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Application\n",
    "We model a delivery network where a driver needs to reach a bakery. The heuristic represents estimated remaining travel time in minutes."
