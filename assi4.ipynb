    "### Understanding the A* Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "A* (pronounced \"A-star\") is a pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm that is widely used for finding the shortest path between two points, called nodes. It is an informed search algorithm, as it uses a heuristic function to guide its search towards the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of A* is the formula:\n",
    "**`f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **`n`** is the next node on the path.\n",
    "- **`g(n)`** is the **actual cost** of the path from the start node to `n`. In our maze, this is the sum of the costs of all cells we have traversed to get to `n`.\n",
    "- **`h(n)`** is the **heuristic (estimated) cost** from `n` to the goal. This is an educated guess. The quality of this guess is crucial for A*'s performance. For the heuristic to be optimal, it must be **admissible**, meaning it never overestimates the actual cost.\n",
    "- **`f(n)`** is the total estimated cost of the path through `n`. A* always explores the node with the lowest `f(n)` value first.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization**: A* starts with a priority queue (often called the \"frontier\" or \"open set\") containing the starting node. The priority is determined by the `f(n)` value.\n",
    "2.  **Iteration**: The algorithm repeatedly extracts the node with the lowest `f(n)` from the priority queue.\n",
    "3.  **Goal Test**: If the extracted node is the goal, the search is complete.\n",
    "4.  **Expansion**: If it's not the goal, the algorithm finds all its neighbors and calculates their tentative `g(n)` and `f(n)` scores.\n",
    "5.  **Update Frontier**: If a neighbor is reached via a cheaper path than before, its scores are updated, and it's added to the priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process guarantees that the first time we reach the goal, it will be through the cheapest possible path."
