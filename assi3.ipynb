    "# DFS Traversal of a Game Map\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "**Depth-First Search (DFS)** explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. Unlike BFS which explores breadth-wise, DFS dives deep into one path until it hits a dead end or the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm: DFS with Cycle Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties:\n",
    "- **Complete**: Yes, in finite graphs with cycle detection\n",
    "- **Optimal**: No, does not guarantee shortest path\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for recursion stack\n",
    "- **Memory Efficient**: Uses less memory than BFS for deep trees\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Steps:\n",
    "1. **Start** at the initial node\n",
    "2. **Mark** current node as visited\n",
    "3. **Check** if current node is the goal:\n",
    "   - If yes, return success\n",
    "   - If no, continue\n",
    "4. **Recursively visit** each unvisited neighbor:\n",
    "   - Try each path until goal is found\n",
    "   - If goal found in any path, return success\n",
    "5. **Backtrack** if all neighbors explored without finding goal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cycle Detection:\n",
    "- Use a `visited` set to track explored nodes\n",
    "- Skip nodes already in visited set\n",
    "- Prevents infinite loops in graphs with cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases:\n",
    "- Maze solving\n",
    "- Topological sorting\n",
    "- Finding connected components\n",
    "- Puzzle solving (like chess moves)"
